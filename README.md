### Short Description :


- This is a ReactJS Documentation project, where one can learn everything about React, Redux & NextJs. This is mainly made with ReactJs.
- Every page of this site has two common things Navbar & Footer.
- In the Navbar section, we have 4 pages of nav links (Docs, Blogs, Contact Us) with dropdowns, and two more buttons (Login & Dark Mood).
- In the Footer, we have a social section on the left side and also have a huge amount of important links in the middle, and a newsletter section on the right side. At the bottom, we also have a copyright section.
- On the Home Page, at first, there is a banner with the search bar. And then the documentation section with a Read More button that takes to the documentation page. Then we have two solutions buttons (Help & FAQ). Before the footer, we have added a reviews slider.
- After that, we have a Doc page, where we have implemented three documentations (ReactJs, ReduxJs & NextJs). Every item has a home page with a Get Started button that takes to the Documentation page.
- And then, we have a dropdown item with three routes (Blogs, Tutorial & Courses). In the blogs page, we have some blogs. And in the Tutorial page, we have some video tutorials.
- Besides, we have another dropdown item named Contact Us, that has two routes (Contact Us & About Us). Contact Us page has details info to contact with us and a form that is featured with mail system. And the About Us page shows info about our team also.
- The Login page will help to login if already registered. If not, then the Register system is also ready.
- Now let’s know some features of our site. By clicking the dark mood, our page will change its theme to dark. We have a scroll-to-top button, that takes to the top section from the bottom. We also have Required Auth system, that protects our routes. We have a dashboard with various roles like Admin, User, etc.
- At last, let's come to the Dashboard. In the dashboard, we have info about a summary of all we have. We have shown it also with an Area Chart. We have used nested routes in the dashboard. An admin can manage all the users, blogs, tutorials, courses, reviews, etc.
